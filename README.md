## **Mobile Application Development Lifecycle**

### We divided the project development lifecycle into 7 stages that you can see below.

### *1. The Research/Planning Stage*

#### In this stage, we have done research on our competitors, and identified main two apps that have similar purposes as ours:
#### “Pets Adoption” by Selfappdeveloper
#### “Pet Adopter” by In Sequence Software
#### During the research, we discovered that the main problem with these apps is a complex pet registration process that requires a lot of information about the pet, and this makes the adoption process impossible for pets that were found outside, that have mixed breeds, and no detailed medical background information. The purpose of our app is to solve this problem by having a convenient and easy-to-fill pet registration form that ensures that all essential information is gathered from the user about the pet and the pets that come from outside (abandoned or stray) will also have a chance to find new families. Our target audience, in this case, is people who do not only want to give their pets for adoption or adopt new ones but also the ones who care about stray pets outside, more precisely people aged 20-40 yo. 
#### Coming to the technical side of the planning, it was the requirement to implement the project on Flutter. We planned to spend on this project 14 weeks as it was stated at the beginning of the course, and our application is not going to be commercialized, so we have no business targets. 

### *2. Wireframes*

#### Here you can see our wireframe diagram, on the next page more detailed one in Figma that is close to the final design.

![app](https://github.com/UsmonovaZulfiya/Meraki_JSE/assets/98756981/91c5453a-2717-47f0-afaf-66a8265e751e) 


### *3. Technical Feasibility & Back-End Assessment*

#### At this stage, we decided to use Firebase to support our background as it is usually done on most applications, it is easy to use (however we have faced a lot of trouble while configuring our project to Firebase and spent a lot of time on fixing it), it provides cloud-firestore (that we have used as NoSQL database) and authentication(particularly email/password sign-in method). Here you can see the initial ER diagram of our database that helped to figure out a lot of moments in the backend, but in Firebase cloud-firestore we are making use of collections and documents:

### *4. Prototyping*

#### View the prototype through this link(check the Flow2 prototype):
#### https://www.figma.com/file/VpH38mxjqcwwBNkkp0xSAf/Pet-Platform?type=design&node-id=193%3A178&mode=design&t=fDFfhDf7GrWRSSmk-1


### *5. Design*

#### In the link above you can see the Figma design also. We decided to use a modest and simple design that won’t overwhelm the user and will be eye-friendly. Main colors: white(FFFFFF), grey(D9D9D9), green(31AA7A). Font: Montserrat.


### *6. Develop*

#### In this stage, we divided(decomposed) the development process into smaller pieces and every team member got different roles. We used GitHub to control the work of all team members as it is the best practice to keep track of version control. In GitHub, we divided each decomposed task into branches and the corresponding member completed the task and made a pull request to the master branch where we made sure that there was always one reviewer to check the code correctness and if there were no conflicts with the master branch. 


### *7. Testing*

#### We have discussed this part in the Black box testing section. 



## **Application Portability**

#### Mobile application portability means that an application can be installed, used, and supported easily on different host environments without needing to change the code. Applications must be portable, in a world where there are multiple mobile operating systems like Android, iOS, and others. A portable application can seamlessly adapt to different hardware, screen sizes, resolutions, and operating system features. This can be beneficial, as it reduces complexity and maintenance costs. Additionally, our app can reach a wider audience and market.

#### How to make an app portable for a wide range of devices? Cross-platform development tools and frameworks are a popular way to ensure mobile app portability. These software solutions enable us to write our app code once and run it on multiple platforms, such as iOS, Android, etc. Below, we have listed some strategies to enhance mobile app portability:

#### 1. Use of Support Libraries and Frameworks: Portability can be substantially improved by using cross-platform frameworks such as React Native, Flutter, or Xamarin. With the help of these frameworks, we can create code only once and have it deployed with little modification across a variety of platforms (including iOS and Android).
#### 2. Responsive and Adaptive Screen Layouts: It's crucial to create UIs that are both responsive and adaptable. This implies that the user interface of the application ought to adapt to various screen sizes and resolutions on its own. Relative layouts and scalable units (such as percentages or ems) on Android and Auto Layout in iOS can be used to do this.
#### 3. Testing on Multiple Devices: Thorough testing across a range of devices and screen sizes can guarantee that the program runs reliably on a variety of hardware.

#### For specific solutions, we can use external sources such as online developer communities (stack overflow), tech blogs and articles (medium, dev.to and etc.), and official framework docs to enhance mobile app portability


## **System and Hardware Requirements**

### *Operating System:*
#### The app may require a minimum version of Android (e.g., Android 6.0 and above) for compatibility.

### *Processor:*
#### A modern processor with a clock speed of at least 1.5 GHz is recommended for this app.

### *Memory (RAM):*
#### A minimum of 2 GB of RAM is required for smooth performance.
#### Recommended 3 GB or more for optimal experience.

### *Storage Space:*
#### Minimum (--) MB of available storage space for app installation.
#### Recommend additional storage space for user-generated content, such as images and saved data.

### *Connectivity:*
#### A stable internet connection is recommended for features such as real-time updates, and image uploads.

### *Minimum Network Speed:*
#### The app should be designed to work with 3G or 4G/LTE networks.

### *Minimum Camera Resolution:*
#### A minimum of 8 MP (megapixels) is considered reasonable for pet profile images.


### *SDK environment:*
#### sdk: '>=3.1.5 <4.0.0'

#### This means our Flutter project requires Dart SDK version 3.1.5 or later, but less than 4.0.0. This information indicates the range of Dart SDK versions that are compatible with your Flutter project.
