## **Mobile Application Development Lifecycle**

### We divided the project development lifecycle into 7 stages that you can see below.

### *1. The Research/Planning Stage*

#### In this stage, we have done research on our competitors, and identified main two apps that have similar purposes as ours:
#### “Pets Adoption” by Selfappdeveloper
#### “Pet Adopter” by In Sequence Software
#### During the research, we discovered that the main problem with these apps is a complex pet registration process that requires a lot of information about the pet, and this makes the adoption process impossible for pets that were found outside, that have mixed breeds, and no detailed medical background information. The purpose of our app is to solve this problem by having a convenient and easy-to-fill pet registration form that ensures that all essential information is gathered from the user about the pet and the pets that come from outside (abandoned or stray) will also have a chance to find new families. Our target audience, in this case, is people who do not only want to give their pets for adoption or adopt new ones but also the ones who care about stray pets outside, more precisely people aged 20-40 yo. 
#### Coming to the technical side of the planning, it was the requirement to implement the project on Flutter. We planned to spend on this project 14 weeks as it was stated at the beginning of the course, and our application is not going to be commercialized, so we have no business targets. 

### *2. Wireframes*

#### Here you can see our wireframe diagram, on the next page more detailed one in Figma that is close to the final design.

![app](https://github.com/UsmonovaZulfiya/Meraki_JSE/assets/98756981/91c5453a-2717-47f0-afaf-66a8265e751e) 


### *3. Technical Feasibility & Back-End Assessment*

#### At this stage, we decided to use Firebase to support our background as it is usually done on most applications, it is easy to use (however we have faced a lot of trouble while configuring our project to Firebase and spent a lot of time on fixing it), it provides cloud-firestore (that we have used as NoSQL database) and authentication(particularly email/password sign-in method). Here you can see the initial ER diagram of our database that helped to figure out a lot of moments in the backend, but in Firebase cloud-firestore we are making use of collections and documents:


### *4. Prototyping*

#### View the prototype through this link(check the Flow2 prototype):
#### https://www.figma.com/file/VpH38mxjqcwwBNkkp0xSAf/Pet-Platform?type=design&node-id=193%3A178&mode=design&t=fDFfhDf7GrWRSSmk-1


### *5. Design*

#### In the link above you can see the Figma design also. We decided to use a modest and simple design that won’t overwhelm the user and will be eye-friendly. Main colors: white(FFFFFF), grey(D9D9D9), green(31AA7A). Font: Montserrat.


### *6. Develop*

#### In this stage, we divided(decomposed) the development process into smaller pieces and every team member got different roles. We used GitHub to control the work of all team members as it is the best practice to keep track of version control. In GitHub, we divided each decomposed task into branches and the corresponding member completed the task and made a pull request to the master branch where we made sure that there was always one reviewer to check the code correctness and if there were no conflicts with the master branch. 


### *7. Testing*

#### We have discussed this part in the Black box testing section.
